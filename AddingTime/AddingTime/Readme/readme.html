<h2><a name="GeneralInfo">General Info</a></h2>

<p>
  AddingTime is a small tool that enables you to quickly enter running times of TV show episodes and calculate them to a season
  running time.
  <br/><br/>
  A data-readout tool like "DVD Decrypter" helps with this task.
  <br/><br/>
  On the left upper side you enter the running time of each episode. You enter the data either as minutes:seconds or as hours:minutes:seconds.
  <br/><br/>
  To enter the data quickly, the following delimters are allowed between numbers: comma &quot;,&quot;, period &quot;.&quot; or colon &quot;:&quot;.
  <br/><br/>
  You need not worry about leading zeros, an entry like 2:3:4 will be interpreted as 2 hours, 3 minutes, 4 seconds.
  <br/><br/>
  By pressing &lt;Enter&gt; you insert the value into the left list.
  <br/><br/>
  The various "Copy" buttons copy the result into the Windows Clipboard.
  <br/><br/>
  The "Move" button moves the result from the left column into the list in the right colum.
  <br/><br/>
  After you've finished all your discs, you can copy the running time on the right column with the various "Copy" buttons
  <br/>

<h3><a name="AnyDVD">AnyDVD</a></h3>
<p>
DVDs will probably work just fine without <a href="http://www.slysoft.com/de/anydvd.html" target="_blank">AnyDVD</a> but for reading Blu-rays most of the time you will need a running AnyDVD.
<br />
This is due to the different kind of copy-protection on the Blu-ray disc system which won't even allow the read-out of meta-data such as running times if your software does not have a licensed decryption key.
</p>

<h3>Read from Disc</h3>
<p>
Reading the running time from the disc itself is a tool to avoid typing errors.
<br />
<br />
Like with any tool, one needs to know how to properly use it.
<br />
<br />
The videos we watch will be encoded on the disc but many times it will not be quite so obvious which tracks are the actual episodes.
<br />
If you have a "Play All" feature on the disc, oftentimes there will be many standard-sized tracks around the 20 minute mark for sitcoms or 42 minute mark for drama series (going by today's US airing standards).
<br />
The "Play All" track will have the combined running times and will usually have a length somewhere between 2 and 3 hours.
<br />
<br />
Sometimes there will be more tracks of the correct length than there are episodes on the disc.
<br />
Check if two tracks have the exact same length and if the disc features audio commentaries. If the number of tracks with different matches your episode count, it's a good bet that these "double" tracks are exactly the commentary episodes. Only select them once.
<br />
<br />
There are other oddities in disc encoding as well, which is why the track container is also shown to give you an overview of the actual disc encoding so that you can make an educated decision.
<br />
<br />
If you are still in doubt, you can always enter the disc in an actual player again and transcribe the running times from there.

<h2><a name="CopyButtons">The Various Copy Buttons</a></h2>

<h3>Copy</h3>

<p>
Copies the rounded minutes from the text box into the Windows Clipboard. It rounds down if the decimal place is less than .5 and up if it's .5 or higher
<br/>
<br/>
You can copy that value directly into DVD Profiler's running time text box.
</p>

<h3>Copy All</h3>

<p>
Copies the formatted running time and the rounded minutes from the text box into the Windows Clipboard. It rounds down if the decimal place is less than .5 and up if it's .5 or higher
<br/>
<br/>
The format looks like this:
<pre>02:43:05	163</pre>
You can copy that value into your profile notes or into the contribution notes.
</p>

<h3>Copy Full</h3>

<p>
Copies the formatted running time and the rounded minutes of all discs from the text box into the Windows Clipboard. It rounds down if the decimal place is less than .5 and up if it's .5 or higher
<br/>
<br/>
The format looks like this:
<pre>02:43:56	164
02:45:17	165
-------------------
05:29:13	329
-------------------</pre>
You can copy that value into your profile notes or into the contribution notes.
