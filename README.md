# AddingTime

Adding Time is intended to sum up run times of TV show episodes. One enters the time as hours:minutes:seconds or as minutes:seconds. Because it’s simpler to do this via the number pad, the following separators are allowed: “:”, “.” and “,”.
To sum up several discs you move the result of one disc to the right side and in the end you can sum up the entire season.

You can also read the data from the disc itself if you have the appropriate drive.
